    <h1>The Old Town</h1>
    <p>Estonia’s Old Town, especially in Tallinn, feels like stepping into a fairytale. Cobblestone streets wind between medieval stone houses, red-tiled roofs, and quiet courtyards that seem untouched by time. Tall church spires rise above the city walls, and every corner carries stories of merchants, knights, and travelers from centuries ago. At sunset, the soft glow of lanterns and café lights makes the Old Town feel warm, calm, and a little magical — a place where history still breathes in everyday life.</p>
