    <h1>The Nature Of Estonia</h1>
    <p>Estonia’s nature is quiet, green, and beautifully untouched. Large forests cover much of the country, filled with pine and birch trees, wildlife, and peaceful walking trails. One of the most unique features is its bogs and wetlands — wide, open landscapes with wooden paths, small pools of water, and misty mornings that feel almost dreamlike.

                        Estonia also has many lakes and rivers, along with a long Baltic Sea coastline and hundreds of small islands. The air feels clean, the scenery changes gently with the seasons, and nature is always close — even near cities. It’s a place where calm, silence, and natural beauty truly stand out</p>
