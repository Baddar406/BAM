                <h2>The Old Twon</h2>
                <p>Estonia’s Old Town, especially in Tallinn, feels like stepping into a fairytale. Cobblestone streets wind between medieval stone houses, red-tiled roofs, and quiet courtyards that seem untouched by time. Tall church spires rise above the city walls, and every corner carries stories of merchants, knights, and travelers from centuries ago. At sunset, the soft glow of lanterns and café lights makes the Old Town feel warm, calm, and a little magical — a place where history still breathes in everyday life.</p>

                <h2>The Map of Estonia</h2>
                <p>Estonia is a small country in Northern Europe, on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. On the map, you’ll see it bordered by Latvia to the south and Russia to the east, with Finland just across the sea to the north.

                    The capital, Tallinn, sits on the north coast, right by the sea — that’s where the famous Old Town is. Estonia also has hundreds of islands scattered along its western coastline, which gives the map a very distinctive, broken-shore look.</p>

                <h2>The Natur Of Estonia</h2>
                <p>Estonia’s nature is quiet, green, and beautifully untouched. Large forests cover much of the country, filled with pine and birch trees, wildlife, and peaceful walking trails. One of the most unique features is its bogs and wetlands — wide, open landscapes with wooden paths, small pools of water, and misty mornings that feel almost dreamlike.

                        Estonia also has many lakes and rivers, along with a long Baltic Sea coastline and hundreds of small islands. The air feels clean, the scenery changes gently with the seasons, and nature is always close — even near cities. It’s a place where calm, silence, and natural beauty truly stand out</p>

                <h2>The Winter In Estonia</h2>
                <p>Winter in Estonia is long, cold, and very atmospheric. Snow often blankets the country, turning forests, towns, and fields into quiet white landscapes. Temperatures usually drop below freezing, especially from December to February, and lakes or even parts of the Baltic Sea can freeze over.

In cities like Tallinn, winter feels especially magical — the Old Town looks like a postcard with snow-covered rooftops, glowing streetlights, and Christmas markets. Days are short, with limited daylight, but that soft winter light gives everything a calm, cozy mood.

Estonians embrace winter with activities like saunas, winter walks, ice skating, and enjoying the silence of nature. It’s a season of stillness, reflection, and simple beauty</p>
