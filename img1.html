    <h1>Geography of Estonia</h1>
    <p>Estonia is a small country in Northern Europe, on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. On the map, you’ll see it bordered by Latvia to the south and Russia to the east, with Finland just across the sea to the north.

                    The capital, Tallinn, sits on the north coast, right by the sea — that’s where the famous Old Town is. Estonia also has hundreds of islands scattered along its western coastline, which gives the map a very distinctive, broken-shore look.</p>
