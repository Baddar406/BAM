    <h1>The Winter In Estonia</h1>
    <p>Winter in Estonia is long, cold, and very atmospheric. Snow often blankets the country, turning forests, towns, and fields into quiet white landscapes. Temperatures usually drop below freezing, especially from December to February, and lakes or even parts of the Baltic Sea can freeze over. In cities like Tallinn, winter feels especially magical — the Old Town looks like a postcard with snow-covered rooftops, glowing streetlights, and Christmas markets. Days are short, with limited daylight, but that soft winter light gives everything a calm, cozy mood. Estonians embrace winter with activities like saunas, winter walks, ice skating, and enjoying the silence of nature. It’s a season of stillness, reflection, and simple beauty</p>
