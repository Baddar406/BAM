    <h1>Summer In Estonia</h1>
    <p>Summer in Estonia is short but beautiful. The weather is mild and pleasant, with long, bright days and cool evenings. One of the most special things about Estonian summer is the “white nights”, when the sun sets very late and the sky stays light almost all night. Nature comes alive in summer — forests turn deep green, lakes are perfect for swimming, and the coastline and islands become popular for relaxation and festivals. People spend more time outdoors, enjoying picnics, cycling, and evenings by the sea.</p>
